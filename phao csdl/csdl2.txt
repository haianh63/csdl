QUESTION 1.Because some orders were canceled but the system still charged customers.
Write 01 query to display customerName, purchasedMoney, paidMoney, canceledMoney, debt. 
If the canceledMoney = debt, add the value "Mistake" to the Note column.


SELECT customerName, (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
									  FROM orderdetails
                                      WHERE orderNumber IN (SELECT orderNumber FROM orders WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber)
                                      ) AS purchasedMoney
								   , (SELECT SUM(amount) 
                                      FROM payments
                                      WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber) AS paidMoney
                                   , (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
									  FROM orderdetails
                                      WHERE orderNumber IN (SELECT orderNumber FROM orders WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber 
                                      AND status = 'Cancelled')
                                      ) AS canceledMoney
                                   , (SELECT purchasedMoney - paidMoney) AS debt
                                   , (IF ((SELECT debt) = (SELECT canceledMoney), 'Mistake', '')) AS Note
FROM customers c
ORDER BY debt DESC;

QUESTION 4.Write 01 query to display full information about customers with the largest and smallest DEBT amounts greater than 0 in the same data table. Note, it doesn't matter whether the order status is
cancelled or not.


(SELECT customerName, 'largest debt' AS Note
FROM
(SELECT *, (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
									  FROM orderdetails
                                      WHERE orderNumber IN (SELECT orderNumber FROM orders WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber)
                                      ) AS purchasedMoney
								   , (SELECT SUM(amount) 
                                      FROM payments
                                      WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber) AS paidMoney		
                                   , (SELECT purchasedMoney - paidMoney) AS debt
FROM customers c) t
WHERE debt > 0
ORDER BY debt DESC LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT customerName, 'smallest debt' AS Note
FROM
(SELECT customerName, (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
									  FROM orderdetails
                                      WHERE orderNumber IN (SELECT orderNumber FROM orders WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber)
                                      ) AS purchasedMoney
								   , (SELECT SUM(amount) 
                                      FROM payments
                                      WHERE customerNumber = c.customerNumber) AS paidMoney		
                                   , (SELECT purchasedMoney - paidMoney) AS debt
FROM customers c) t
WHERE debt > 0
ORDER BY debt ASC LIMIT 1)
