3.Write 1 query to display name, text description, and the total quantity of products of productlines that have total quantity of products greater than 50000. Sort them in descending order of quantity (total quantity of products = in stock + sold)

SELECT pl.*, (SELECT SUM(quantityInStock)
					 FROM products
                     WHERE productline = pl.productline) AS totalInStock, 
                     (SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered)

FROM productlines pl
HAVING totalQuantity >= 50000
ORDER BY totalQuantity DESC;

4.productCode productName profit1 profit2 difference group
 6 cột
profit1 là sum của quantityOrder * (msrp - buyPrice)

profit2 là sum của quantityOrder * (priceEach - buyPrice)

difference là profit1 - profit2

4 chữ cái đầu trong tên < 1940 thì là group1, còn lại là 2 (kể cả mấy con 18th century)
